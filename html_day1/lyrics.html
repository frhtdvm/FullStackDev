        mind, but what do you mean I am the one Who will dance on the floor in
        the round?" She said I am the one</span

      <span>
        Who will dance on the floor in the round She told me her name was Billie
        Jean as she caused a scene Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
        of being the one Who will dance on the floor in the round</span

        she′s in demand? Her schemes and plans ′Cause we danced on the floor in
        the round (hee) So take my strong advice Just remember to always think
        twice (Don't think twice!) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo) She told my baby
        we′d danced 'til 3:00, then she looked at me Then showed a photo of a
        baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh, no) ′Cause we danced on the
